# 30 Days of JavaScript - LeetCode Challenge

This repository contains my solutions and practice work for the [LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/) study plan. This challenge is designed to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on problem-solving.

## About the Challenge

The 30 Days of JavaScript study plan covers essential JavaScript concepts including closures, promises, array transformations, and object-oriented programming. Each problem builds upon previous concepts, helping to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

## Problem Categories

### [Closures](./closures/)

Problems focusing on JavaScript closures, function scope, and lexical environment.

**Problems:**

- [Create Hello World Function](./closures/2667-create-hello-world-function/)
- [Counter](./closures/2620-counter/)
- [To Be Or Not To Be](./closures/2704-to-be-or-not-to-be/)

### [Basic Array Transformations](./basic-array-transformations/)

Array manipulation and transformation techniques.

**Problems:**

- ***

### [Function Transformations](./function-transformations/)

Higher-order functions and function composition patterns.

**Problems:**

- ***

### [Promises and Time](./promises-and-time/)

Asynchronous JavaScript, promises, and time-based operations.

**Problems:**

- ***

### [JSON](./json/)

Working with JSON data, parsing, and manipulation.

**Problems:**

- ***

### [Classes](./classes/)

Object-oriented programming concepts, classes, and prototypes.

**Problems:**

- ***

## Repository Structure

The project is organized by topic. Each topic folder contains a README that serves as a map for that category.

For every problem, a dedicated folder is created containing:

- `solution.js`: The actual code solution.
- `README.md`: The problem description.

### Example Structure

```text
