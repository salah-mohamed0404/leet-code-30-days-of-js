# 30 Days of JavaScript - LeetCode Challenge

This repository contains my solutions and practice work for the [LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/) study plan. This challenge is designed to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on problem-solving.

## About the Challenge

The 30 Days of JavaScript study plan covers essential JavaScript concepts including closures, promises, array transformations, and object-oriented programming. Each problem builds upon previous concepts, helping to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

## Problem Categories

### 🔄 [Closures](./closures/)

Problems focusing on JavaScript closures, function scope, and lexical environment.

**Problems:**

-

## Repository Structure

The project is organized by topic. Each topic folder contains a README that serves as a map for that category.

For every problem, a dedicated folder is created containing:

- `solution.js`: The actual code solution.
- `README.md`: The problem description.

### Example Structure

```text
root/
├── topic-name/               # e.g., closures
│   ├── README.md             # Topic map
